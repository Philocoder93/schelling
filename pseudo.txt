ND: Excellent organization here. Clear plan of what you're trying to accomplish

first build the board
in order to do this run a loop 25 times
each time create an object and every fifth time attach a
class to them that causes them to wrap
at the end of that you should have a 5 by 5 board

next you need to randomly attach either a red or a blue or no object to each
in order to do this let the bottom left hand corner of the square be the origin
in a cartesian coordinate system. So the bottom left hand square is at coordinate
1,1 the square to the right is 2,1 the one above is 1,2 and so on, define two
5 valued arrays, x and y. each should have 1-5 in it, nest a loop over the second
array within a loop over the first array. at each coordinate generate a random
number, include some control flow here, 1/3 chance of blue 1/3 chance of red
1/3 chance of nothing. if get blue or red create an object that has the information
both that it is red / blue as well as its x and y coordinates

important: loop is probably screwing up because the print is outside the if loop so the
var never gets reset


use the instanceof property to check which object are made using which
constructor.

//this is some lefotver code from the main

//alternate notation for the object constructors
// Object.defineProperty(this, "x", {
//   get: function() {
//     return x;
//   },
//   set: function(newName) {
//     name = newName;
//   },
//   configurable: false
// });
// Object.defineProperty(this, "y", {
//   get: function() {
//     return y;
//   },
//   set: function(newName) {
//     name = newName;
//   },
//   configurable: false
// });
