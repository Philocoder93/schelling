This project does not use 2d arrays like other, similar projects, rather, it represents each square with an object in an array
which possesses two keys: x and y. These keys are used to line objects up with their appropriate squares and apply the styles
contained in the objects.

This project utilizes three object constructors that are pushed to arrays. It also utilizes the Math.random() method.

user stories:
1. As a user, I should be able to reset the board when I want to so that I can look for a game with possible moves.
2. As a user, I should be able to find out about the model I'm looking at so that I can understand what I'm looking at.
3. As a user, I should be able to find out about the inventor of the model so that I can understand what I'm looking at.
4. As a user, I should be able to run the simulation for as many iterations as I want so that I can watch situations out to the end.
5. As a user, I should be able to resize the board to as large or as small as I want.

User story 5 requires new functionality that I will add later.

New Step only works some of the time. 

Need to radically simplify/ clean up the code.
