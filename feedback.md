 ## Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **3: Excelling.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **3: Excelling.** You've definitely hit the requirements here, and pushed yourself by selecting a challenging project and implementing `try, catch`.

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **2: Performing.** You did a great job here. Some things to be mindful of, as I note in my inline comments, is to use appropriate naming. Additionally, add more pseudocode in your JS file, there were moments when it was difficult to figure out what was going on in your code.

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **2: Performing.** Generally clean design, but the text in the headers look a little cramped. Maybe have larger divs there. Also, it would be helpful for a user to have some text on the app itself explaining how they should interact with the it and what they're actually seeing.
